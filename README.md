This tool allows you to convert private keys into addresses, then uses an open API to check that address for a balance.

You should not use this to steal bitcoins.  That is wrong.  

If you decide to use the 'random search' function, you are setting off for a long, lonely journey into the land of "Improbable".


## Major props to the creator of 'https://github.com/matja/bitcoin-tool' which is likely the only part of this repo that makes sense or has value.
